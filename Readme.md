# LSTM_Text_Generation
This is a project from my time at General Assembly.  contains code for text generation through Keras.

## Be advised, this is a work in progress
This repo contains the jupyter notebook with code for 
1. Cleaning your corpus (from a dataframe)
2. Preprocessing steps
3. Model setup
4. Text generation setup

## Text Generator
If you find this repo and the code has not been highlighted with its purpose in the process, I will get to it shortly.  This is definitely a learned experience, so add things as you see fit.

## Project Details
I trained an LSTM on a corpus of speeches from 6 notable dictators.  My hope was to generate convincing text in the style of these dictators.  Within the repository, you will find a csv containing portions of the corpus with label indicating the speaker. **I would encourage adding to this corpus**.  As far as I know, there aren't any labeled sources out there.  This could also he helpful for a classification problem.

This code uses insights from Jason Brownlee, Nathan Raw, J Beightol and James Babyak
